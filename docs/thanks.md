# Special Thanks
My wholehearted gratitude goes to folks on Aegis City Discord; thanks for your support and encouragement, as well as showing me stuff and giving ideas. This guide wouldn't have existed without you. I'm also extremely grateful to everyone giving feedback or just saying thanks; because of you, I feel like all of this wasn't for nothing. Shoutouts to:

- @StatuoTW - for your gens, ideas, and creating this beautiful community.

- @Siberys - for ideas, discussions on different image gen topics, and support.

- @11yu - for huge help with Samplers, Schedulers and ComfyUI, as well as general knowledge.

- @Corgi - for help with Tag Bleeding and Overtraining.

- @MadDetective - for help with tags.

- @Skelly - for support.

I really fucking hope I didn't forget anyone. Tell me if I did. Bex out.
