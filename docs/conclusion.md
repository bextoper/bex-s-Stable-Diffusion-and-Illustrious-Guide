# Conclusion
I think that's all, besides img2img and ControlNet, but I have literally 0 strength left to investigate and document them as well. Maybe some other time. That's basically months of my experience with Stable Diffusion and Illustrious, dozens of hours spent clicking letters on the keyboard, smashing "Generate", sucking ass, gens failing, remaking prompts, finally coming to understand shit, experiment with basically everything there is, testing models, prompts, interactions between tags, shit like that. Besides my dramatic mood right now, of course I didn't talk about everything; it's impossible for one man to do, and I'm not aiming to. I really hope that this guide was at least a little bit useful, and that you learned something new. I wish you luck and all the best; be creative, make stuff, think for yourself, be happy and take care.
