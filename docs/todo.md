# To-Do List

*(since mkdocs apparently doesn't understand crossed out text, having ~~ ~~ in between stuff means that it's done. I'll figure something out... someday...)*

- img2img and Inpainting (In Process)
- ControlNet, specifically Style Cloning
- Hyper-LoRA section. Credits to @Siberys.
- ~~Rewrite Installation section to feature ForgeUI instead of reForge.~~ Kinda did it. Still need to overhaul it properly.
- ~~Mention Infinite Image Browsing Extension. It's incredible.~~
- Make a Hands Manifesto. Fuck you hands.
- LatentModifier.
- ~~Mixing Natural Language and Tags on Illustrious 1.0/1.1 models.~~
- ~~IPNDM_V section; simply the best Sampler I ever tried.~~ Credits to @11yu
- ~~DEIS SGM Uniform section.~~ Credits to @11yu
- More Screenshots
- ~~Explain "Illustrious"~~
- ~~CFG++ section.~~
- Make the first part of the guide more beginner-friendly
- ~~ComfyUI section. I finally somewhat learned it.~~
- Expand the section on multiple character gens. I'm absolutely sure there's a way to get 2/3 characters gens consistent, I just need to find the exact formula.
- "Notable Tags" section.
- Get a life (will never happen).
